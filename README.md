## Webex Teams notifier for Observium

This simple script can run on-box with Observium (somewhere in the web path Ex. ../html/...) and Observium can call the script as a Webhook contact for alerting. When Observium posts a JSON alert notification, the script will decode the payload and pass the alert details over to a designated Cisco Webex Teams Space.
